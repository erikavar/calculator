# Calculator

This is a basic calculator. 

The user can click the buttons on the screen to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. There is an AC button to clear everything and a backspace button so the user can undo if needed.

## What I Learned

* You can add more than one class to an element
* How to disable buttons with `.disabled`
* If you use `querySelectorAll` you need to then use `forEach` to go through all the selected elements
* Variables are initialized as `undefined` when declared, until assigned otherwise
* Can use the className property to set or return the class name of an element
* How to use splice (arrays only) and slice methods
